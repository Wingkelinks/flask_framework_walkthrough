<p>
	The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in
	Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in recapturing his long lost family
	inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain
	when Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an
	adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf decided to add Bilbo
	to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to
	force. Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes
	prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious Dwarves also
	considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
	leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

		<h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
		<p>
			Thorin II "Oakenshield", eventually called King under the Mountain or
			Mountain King, was the son of Thráin II, the older brother of Frerin and
			Dís, the grandson of King Thrór and the uncle of Fíli and Kíli. Thorin was
			best known for his deeds as leader of a company that infiltrated the lost
			Kingdom under the Mountain to take it back from Smaug and for leading an
			alliance of Men, Dwarves, and Elves in the Battle of Five Armies.

		<h3>Fili and Kili</h3>
		<p>
			Fíli and Kíli were brothers, the youngest of the thirteen dwarves who set
			out with Thorin Oakenshield's company, along with Gandalf and Bilbo
			Baggins, to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug.
			<br />
			Fíli and Kíli were the two most active dwarves of Thorin's company, and
			apart from Balin, and possibly Bombur, they appeared more frequently as
			"individual" characters in Tolkien's novel than the rest of Thorin's
			companions, who were most often named only in "group" references to the
			entire company.

		<h3>Óin</h3>
		<p>
			Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle
			of Gimli. Oin's uncle was Fundin, the father of Balin and Dwalin. He
			usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought in the
			Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined
			with Thorin and Company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain
			wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo
			would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his
			brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company
			as they were the most skilled out of the others. He fought in and survived
			the Battle of Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain with
			King Dain Ironfoot II along with many other dwarves of The Company of
			Thorin.

		<h3>Glóin</h3>
		<p>
			Glóin son of Gróin was one of the Dwarves of Thorin II Oakenshield's
			company who set out to reclaim the Lonely Mountain in the Quest of Erebor.
			He was also the father of Gimli, who became a member of the Fellowship of
			the Ring. Glóin chiefly appears in The Hobbit as a supporting character.
			Glóin also appears in The Fellowship of the Ring during the Fellowship's
			stay in Rivendell.
